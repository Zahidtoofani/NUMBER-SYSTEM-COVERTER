"NUMBER SYSTEM CONVERTER" is a simple project which takes a number of any number system and convert that number to other number systems, 
eg if you provide input number in Decimal number system it will convert the number into Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal Number Systems.
I have used Pyhon Programming Language to build this project.
The approach I have used is definitely not the best way because I created it when I was a beginner and had no experiance.
It is not my first project but it is definitely among my begining projects (probabily the forth one)
